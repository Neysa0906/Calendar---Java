# Text Calendar (Java Console App)

This is a simple **console-based calendar generator** written in Java.  
It was originally created as my **9th grade mini software project** and later cleaned up and uploaded to GitHub.

## What the program does

- Asks the user for:
  - A **year** (e.g. `2025`)
  - A **month name** (e.g. `January`)
  - The **weekday of the 1st day** of that month (e.g. `Sunday`)
- Calculates the **number of days in the month** (including leap year handling for February).
- Prints a **nicely formatted text calendar** with days from **Sunday to Saturday**.

## How it works (logic)

- Uses a fixed list of month names and days in each month.
- Checks for leap year using:
  - Leap year if:
    - `year % 400 == 0`, or  
    - `year % 4 == 0` and `year % 100 != 0`
- Maps weekday names (`Sunday`, `Monday`, etc.) to an index from `0` to `6`.
- Fills a `6 x 7` 2D array with dates and prints it as a calendar grid.

## Sample Output
